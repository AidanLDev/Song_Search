# Song Search

A project show how to handle data fetching in a Next app. Using a json file with 500 tracks you can use the frontend to get track details either searching by artist or by the track name itself.

I wrote this using a Node/Express back-end in the past, but after Heroku ended their free-tier I migrated the app to Next.js so I could easily host it on Vercel for free.
